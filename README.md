# Quasi Morphisms for Almost Full relations

This project is an artifact for a [TYPES 2024](https://types2024.itu.dk/Index.html) submission of the
same name. The standalone Coq file [`af_morphism.v`](af_morphism.v)
contains the developement and is largely commented. It is intented
to be read and executed within an IDE for Coq such 
as eg [CoqIDE](https://coq.inria.fr/download) or 
[vscoq](https://github.com/coq-community/vscoq). Any version
of Coq starting from `8.13` and upto at least `8.18` should
be ok.
